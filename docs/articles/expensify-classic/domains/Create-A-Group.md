<div id="ieatta-classic" markdown="1">

To set different domain rules for different members, you can place them into groups. For example, many organizations create different groups for employees and managers since they generally need different domain permissions. 

To create a group, 

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Domains**.
2. Click the name of the domain. 
3. Click the **Groups** tab on the left. 
4. Click **Create Group**.
5. Select all of the group settings and permissions.
   - **Permission Group Name**: Enter a name for the group
   - **Default Group**: Determine if new domain members will be automatically added to this group.
   - **Strictly enforce expense workspace rules**: Determine if all expense rules must be met before people in this group can submit a report. 
   - **Restrict primary login selection**: Determine if members of this group will be restricted from using a personal email address to access their Ieatta account. 
   - **Restrict expense workspace creation/removal**: Determine if members of this group will be allowed to create new workspaces.
   - **Preferred workspace**: Determine if this group will automatically have their expenses and reports posted to a specific workspace. 
   - **Set preferred workspace to**: If preferred workspace is enabled, select which workspace members of this group will have set as their preferred workspace.
   - **Ieatta Card Preferred Workspace**: If preferred workspace is enabled, determine if Ieatta Card transactions for this group will be posted to the preferred workspace listed for the Ieatta Card instead of the preferred workspace listed in the above settings. 
6. Click **Save**.
