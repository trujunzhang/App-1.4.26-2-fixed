description: Automatically send candidates from Greenhouse to Ieatta for easy reimbursement
---

# Overview
Ieatta's direct integration with Greenhouse allows you to automatically send candidates from Greenhouse to Ieatta for easy reimbursement. The integration can set the candidate's recruiter or recruiting coordinator as approver in Ieatta.

## Prerequisites of the integration
- You must be a Workspace Admin in Ieatta and an Admin in Greenhouse with Developer Permissions to complete this connection. This can be the same person or two different people.
- Each Greenhouse candidate record must have an email address in order to send to Ieatta since we use this as the unique identifier in Ieatta.
- We highly recommend that you create a specific Ieatta workspace for candidates so that you can set up a separate workflow and a different set of Categories and Tags from what your employees would see.
