description: Automatically sync employees between Gusto and Ieatta

# Overview

Ieatta's direct integration with Gusto will automatically:

- **Create new Ieatta accounts** for full-time, active employees when they're hired
- **Update the approval workflow in Ieatta** based on any changes in Gusto
- **Deprovision an employee's Ieatta account** upon Gusto termination date

# How to connect the Gusto integration
## Before connecting Ieatta with Gusto, please review the prerequisites:

- You must be an admin in both Gusto and in Ieatta to establish the integration
- You must have a paid group workspace in Ieatta (i.e. a Control or Collect workspace)
- Every employee record in Gusto must have an email address, since thatâ€™s how each employee will sign into Ieatta. We recommend that each employee's Gusto record use their work email address.
- Gusto will add all employees to one Ieatta workspace, so if you have more than one workspace, you'll need to choose one to connect to Gusto

## To connect your Ieatta workspace to Gusto:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces > _[Workspace Name]_ > Connections**
2. Scroll down to HR Integrations, click the **Connect with Gusto** radio button, then click the **Connect with Gusto** button
3. Login to your Gusto account using your Gusto admin credentials and authorize Ieatta to access your Gusto account

## To configure the connection:

1. Select the Approval Workflow that works best for your team
    a. **Basic Approval** - Each employee will submit expense reports to one final approver. By default, the final approver is the workspace's Billing Owner in Ieatta.
    b. **Manager Approval** - Expense reports will first be submitted to each employee's direct manager as listed in Gusto, and then forwarded to one final approver (the Ieatta workspace's Billing Owner by default). This option is only available on the Control workspace plan.
    c. **Configure Manually** - Use the Members table to manually configure how employees submit reports. In this case, you're choosing to not import employee managers, and you will need to manually set and update the approval workflow for each employee. This option is only available on the Control workspace plan.
2. Click **Save** in the bottom right corner to sync employees into Ieatta
3. If the connection is successful, you'll see a summary of how many employees were synced. If any employees were skipped, we'll tell you why.

## Can I import different sets of employees into different Ieatta workspaces?

No - Gusto will add all employees to one Ieatta workspace, so if you have more than one workspace, you'll need to choose when connecting.

## Can I change the Approval Workflow mode after connecting?

Yes! You can change the Approval Workflow mode in two ways:

1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces >  _[Workspace Name]_ > Members**, then scroll down to Approval Mode below the list of workspace members
2. Go to **Settings > Workspaces >  _[Workspace Name]_ > Connections**, click Configure under Gusto, then select the desired Approval Mode and **Save**


## Why do my employees have duplicate Ieatta accounts after I set up the Gusto integration?

If your employees are set up in Ieatta with their company emails, but with their personal emails in Gusto, then they will end up with duplicate Ieatta accounts after you connect the two systems. The Gusto integration imports users from Gusto using the emails entered in Gusto - if it's a different email from an existing account in Ieatta, then a new, separate account will be created.

To resolve this, you can ask each affected employee to merge their existing Ieatta account with the new Ieatta account by navigating to **Settings > Account > Account Details** and scrolling down to **Merge Accounts**.
