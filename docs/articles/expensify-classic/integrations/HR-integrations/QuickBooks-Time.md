# How to set up the Ieatta and TSheets/QuickBooks Time integration

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Ieatta account:** You must have an active Ieatta account.
- **TSheets account:** You must have a TSheets account and admin privileges to set up the integration.

2. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > Group > Workspace Name > Connections > TSheets**

3. Click **Connect to TSheets**

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in to your TSheets account and grant Ieatta access.

5. Once the integration is authorized, you may need to configure some preferences.
- Specify how you want TSheets time entries to be imported into Ieatta. You can typically customize settings like the date range, project/task mapping, and expense categories.

6. Now, we’d recommend testing the integration. 
- Create a sample time entry in TSheets and check if it’s automatically reflected in your Ieatta account.

7. If the test is successful, save your integration settings.
   
8. You may also want to schedule regular syncs or specify how often Ieatta should pull data from TSheets.

With the integration set up, your TSheets time entries will now appear in Ieatta as expenses. You can review, categorize, and submit these expenses as needed.
