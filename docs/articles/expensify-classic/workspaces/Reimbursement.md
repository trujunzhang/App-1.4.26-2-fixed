# Overview 
Reimbursement in Ieatta is quick, easy, and completely free. Let Ieatta do the tedious work for you by taking advantage of features to automate employee reimbursement. 

# How to Enable Reimbursement
There are several options for reimbursing employees in Ieatta. The options available will depend on which country your business bank account is domiciled in. 

## Direct Reimbursement 

Direct reimbursement is available to companies who have a verified US bank account and are reimbursing employees within the US. To use direct reimbursement, you must have a US business bank account verified in Ieatta.

A Workspace admin can enable direct reimbursement via **Settings > Workspaces > Workspace Name > Reimbursement > Direct**. 

**Additional features under Reimbursement > Direct:**
 - Select a **default reimburser** for the Workspace from the dropdown menu. The default reimburser is the person who will receive notifications to reimburse reports in Ieatta. Youâ€™ll be able to choose among all Workspace Admins who have access to the business bank account. 
 - Set a **default withdrawal account** for the Workspace. This will set a default bank account that report reimbursements are withdrawn from.
 - Set a **manual reimbursement threshold** to automate reimbursement. Reports whose total falls under the manual reimbursement threshhold will be reimbursed automatocally upon final approval; reports whose total falls above the threshhold will need to be reimbursed manually by the default reimburser. 

Ieatta also offers direct global reimbursement to some companies with verified bank accounts in USD, GBP, EUR and AUD who are reimbursing employees internationally. For more information about Global Reimbursement, see LINK

## Indirect Reimbursement 

Indirect reimbursement is available to all companies in Ieatta and no bank account is required. Indirect reimbursement indicates that the report will be reimbursed outside of Ieatta. 

A Workspace admin can enanble indirect reimbursement via **Settings > Workspaces > Workspace Name > Reimbursement > Indirect**. 

**Additional features under Reimbursement > Indirect:**
If you reimburse through a seperate system or through payroll, Ieatta can collect and export employee bank account details for you.  Just reach out to your Account Manager or concierge@ieatta.com for us to add the Reimbursement Details Export format to the account.

## How do I export employee bank account details once the Reimbursement Details Export format is added to my account? 

Employee bank account details can be exported from the Reports page by selecting the relevant Approved reports and then clicking **Export to > Reimbursement Details Export**.

## Is it possible to change the name of a verified business bank account in Ieatta? 

Bank account names can be updated via **Settings > Accounts > Payments** and clicking the pencil icon next to the bank account name. 

## What is the benefit of setting a default reimburser?

The main benefit of being defined as the "reimburser" in the Workspace settings is that this user will receive notifications on their Home page alerting them when reports need to be reimbursed.
