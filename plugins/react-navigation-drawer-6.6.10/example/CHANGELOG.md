### BREAKING CHANGES

* This drops the mode prop on the navigator in favor of a per-screen option animationPresentation
* headerMode is now moved to options instead of props
* This commit moves options from `drawerContentOptions` to regular `options` in order to reduce confusion between the two, as well as to make it more flexible to configure the drawer on a per screen basis.
* We need to add support for specifying style for tab bar in options to support the use cases which need this.
* Previously, the stack header accepted scene and previous scene which contained things such as descriptor, navigation prop, progress etc. The commit simplifies them to pass `route`, `navigation`, `options` and `progress` directly to the header. Similaryly, the `previous` argument now contains `options`, `route` and `progress`.
